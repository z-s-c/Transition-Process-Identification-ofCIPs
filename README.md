Fault Monitoring-oriented Transition Process Identification of Complex Industrial Processes with Neighbor Inconsistent Pair-based Attribute Reduction It is used to deal with complex industrial processes with multiple operating modes By identifying the transition process, the process monitoring efficiency is improved and the false alarm rate of fault monitoring is reduced. The incremental attribute reduction method based on neighborhood inconsistency is used to reduce the dimension of data. Using the adaptive sliding window method and the attribute reduction results, the running modes are divided into sub stages.
